## üß† **Agent Workflow Steps**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Planner Agent**:  
   Orchestrates the workflow by coordinating all other agents dynamically.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Serper Tool**:  
   Fetches relevant URLs using the **Google SERP API**.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Selector Agent**:  
   Selects the best URL for scraping based on relevance and quality.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Scraper Agent**:  
   Extracts the weather data from the selected URL.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Reporter Agent**:  
   Formats the extracted data into a meaningful and readable report.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Reviewer Agent**:  
   Ensures the accuracy and quality of the data before proceeding.

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Router Node**:  
   Dynamically reroutes tasks to handle failures (e.g., if a URL doesn‚Äôt work, it selects another one).

8Ô∏è‚É£ **Final Report Generator**:  
   Compiles all validated data into the final weather report.
